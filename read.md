## 📘 Introduction
This repository follow the video series from Marcko  that guides you from the fundamentals to more advanced techniques in Revit plugin development.<br/>

As next steps I wish to implement on a new branch new features like use AWS or Azure as Cloud Repository for Revit Families, different style for WPF items, etc.

> **Note:** This implementation focuses on raw functionality without complex resource management, ensuring you get hands-on experience with core plugin elements.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites
- **Revit 2023 or later** (ensure the API version aligns with your Revit installation)
- **Visual Studio 2022 or later** with .NET Framework support
- **Revit API SDK** (included with the Revit installation)

## 🚀 Setup & Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jmatiasmn/Family-Manager-Plugin
